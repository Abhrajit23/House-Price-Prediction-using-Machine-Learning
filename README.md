# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning  
**By:** Abhrajit Das  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project uses regression models to predict house prices based on input features like square footage, location, and number of rooms. It’s designed to support real estate decision-making with data-driven valuation.

## 📌 Problem Statement  
House price estimation often suffers from inconsistency and subjectivity. This project addresses that by building reliable machine learning models that predict property value with high accuracy.

## ✅ Solution Approach  
- Conducted thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset (scaling, encoding, etc.)  
- Trained and compared multiple regression models  
- Visualized feature importance and residuals  

## 📂 Dataset Highlights  
Features include:  
- Bedrooms, bathrooms  
- Square footage (living, lot)  
- Zip code, year built  
- Renovation status  
- **Target:** Sale Price

## 🤖 Models Implemented  
- **Linear Regression**  
- **Random Forest Regressor**  
- **XGBoost Regressor**  
- **Lasso & Ridge Regression**

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- R² Score  
- Residual & Actual vs. Predicted Plots

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- XGBoost  

## 💡 Key Takeaways  
XGBoost outperformed other models with the highest R² and lowest error metrics, validating its strength in structured data scenarios like real estate analytics.
