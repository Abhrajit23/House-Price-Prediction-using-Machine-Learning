🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
By: Abhrajit Das

🔍 Project Overview
This project uses regression models to predict house prices based on multiple input variables such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and more. The aim is to empower real estate stakeholders with accurate valuation models.

📌 Problem Statement
Estimating house prices is often subjective and prone to bias. A data-driven prediction model can help homeowners, buyers, and investors make more informed decisions in real estate transactions.

✅ Solution Approach
Performed extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Preprocessed data with feature scaling and encoding

Trained and evaluated multiple regression algorithms

Visualized model performance and feature impact

📂 Dataset Highlights
The dataset includes key attributes like:

Number of bedrooms and bathrooms

Living area square footage

Zip code and location

Year built, renovation status

Target variable: house sale price
